<!-- Javascript Data Types
JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

Primitive data type
Non-primitive (reference) data type
JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. For example:

JavaScript primitive data types
There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:

Data Type Description
String represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
Number represents numeric values e.g. 100
Boolean represents boolean value either false or true
Undefined represents undefined value
Null represents null i.e. no value at all

JavaScript non-primitive data types
The non-primitive data types are as follows:
Data Type Description
Object represents instance through which we can access members
Array represents group of similar values
RegExp represents regular expression -->
