<!-- Bullet Points 2-
 
 We can write javascript code either inside body or head but its highly recommend to use inside body because first load page then javascript.
 variables can be used to hold values.Variables are declared with the var keyword.
 javascript variable is container for storing the values.
 creating the variable is called in javascript as declaring the value.
 we can declared javascript variable as var keyward.
 All javascript variables must be identified with unique name.
 Thease unique name as called identifiers.
 var a=10;
 
 var=a; ------------------ undefined
 var d="rahul"; --------------String -->
