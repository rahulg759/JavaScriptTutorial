<!-- comparison Operators in Javascript
Operator Description
== Is equal to - It will check value only.
=== Is identical (is equal to and is of the same type)- It will check datatype also.
!= Is not equal to
!== Is not identical

Assignment Operators in javascript
Operator Description
= Assign
+= Add and assign. For example, x+=y is the same as x=x+y.
-= Subtract and assign. For example, x-=y is the same as x=x-y.
*= Multiply and assign. For example, x*=y is the same as x=x*y.
/= Divide and assign. For example, x/=y is the same as x=x/y.
%= Modulus and assign. For example, x%=y is the same as x=x%y. -->
